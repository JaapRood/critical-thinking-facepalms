# Critical Thinking Facepalms

> Demonstrable proof that we need more critical thought in politics, business, and society.

This project is an attempt to collect and collate examples of embarrassingly bad, face palm inducing reasoning.  One day soonish, I'll build a searchable interface to make the purveyors of poor thought easier to find.  Unitl then, you'll need to trawl the headlines in [`/facepalms`](/facepalms).
